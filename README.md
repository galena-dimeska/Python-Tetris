# Python - Tetris

This project is a recreation of the classic game Tetris, in which playerâ€™s use the left, right, down, x znd z keys in order to move, drag down, or rotate one of seven different types of falling blocks, with the goal of fitting them like a puzzle and having as many full rows as possible. 

When a row is fully complete and without any gaps, it disappears, creating more space to keep playing. The game ends when the blocks reach the top of the game window.

The side bar of game window has the functionality of keeping track of the score, as well as the high score on the device, along with showing the player the next block.

Part of this project's code was done by following a tutorial by (https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithnick), the music and sound effects also being taken from them.
